# End-To-End-Bank-Churners-Prediction
# Overview

In the banking industry, it is important to predict and understand when customers might decide to end their relationship with the bank, known as customer churn. When customers leave, it can lead to financial losses and impact the bank's reputation.By identifying customers who are likely to churn, the bank can proactively take measures to retain them and minimize revenue loss.Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately predict customer churn in order to take proactive steps to retain these customers.
Using a source of 10,000 bank records, we created an app to demonstrate the ability to apply machine learning models to predict the likelihood of customer churn.
